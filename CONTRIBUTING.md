# Contributing

Great to have you here!

There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.

## Did you find a bug?

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/K15t/aui-ng2/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/K15t/aui-ng2/issues/new). 
  Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable 
  test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Adding new features or provide a bug fix

We love pull requests from everyone! For details about using pull-requests, please see github's help on pull-request.

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/feature-name.git

Follow the [readme](https://github.com/K15t/aui-ng2/blob/master/README.md) to setup the project on your local system.

If the project is setup, you can start now:

* Make your change
* Add tests for it 
* Make the tests pass
* Add documentation where necessary

Push to your fork, rebase it with the latest master and submit a pull request.

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests
within three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggest
some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests
* Follow our [style guide][style]
* Write a [good commit message][commit]
