### i18n
aui-ng2 requires [ng2-translate](https://github.com/ocombe/ng2-translate) because some components
contain text labels which have to be translated to the users locale. If you want to use aui-ng you need to
configure ng2-translate in your angular app. Translations for English and German are provided with the library. You can combine them with your exisiting translations or provide your own.
